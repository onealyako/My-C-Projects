Assignment 2 

How to Use:
	- Use the makefile to compile both programs
	- Use 'make all' to create q1 & q2

	- This program is ./q2 displays the solution to a postfix expression that is provided by the user.

Sample Output:
**********
Enter Postfix Expression: 
13+

The postfix result is: 4
**********

NOTE: Q1 not included. Makefile may not work (this is for privacy reasons so that my work is not plagiarized). Feel free to look at my code however and try to compile it yourself.
